        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Robert Carlyle OBE (born 14 April 1961) is a Scottish actor. His film
          work includes Trainspotting (1996) and its sequel (2017), The Full
          Monty (1997), The World Is Not Enough (1999), and Angela's Ashes
          (1999). He has been in the television shows Hamish Macbeth, Stargate
          Universe, and Once Upon a Time. He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor
          in a Leading Role for The Full Monty and a Gemini Award for Stargate

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Carlyle was born in Maryhill, Glasgow, the son of Elizabeth, a bus
          company employee, and Joseph Carlyle, a painter and decorator. He was
          brought up by his father after his mother left when Carlyle was four
          years old. He left school at the age of 16 without any qualifications
          and worked for his father as a painter and decorator; however, he
          continued his education by attending night classes at Cardonald
          College in Glasgow.

              My first love is art, and I see a lot of things in an artistic
              way.
            </div>
            <div class="swiper-slide">
              I love sci-fi because it leads in the imagination, and I always
              say it has the most intelligent fans in the world.

            <div class="swiper-slide">
              (On making Full Monty (1997)): I thought it was a load of fucking
              pish, to be honest.
            </div>
            <div class="swiper-slide">
              The first thing you should know about me is when I was three years
              old my mother left me and my father. And that was traumatic
              obviously for my father - he suffered a nervous breakdown at that
              time in his life.
            </div>
            <div class="swiper-slide">
              On his wife: We met in Cracker (1993). I played a maniac fan who
              murders a policeman and she did my makeup. I thought anyone
              interested in me looking like that must have genuinely liked me.

              Guys, particularly in the West, go to the gym and train for hours
              and hours to pick up something that is heavier than them. Why
              would you want to do that?
            </div>
            <div class="swiper-slide">
              The more people know about an actor the less convincing they
              become. A bit of mystery's a good thing.
